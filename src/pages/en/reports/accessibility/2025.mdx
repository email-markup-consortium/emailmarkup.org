We have spent the last year collecting emails as part of our [data collection project](../../../projects/#data-collection). Since the last report, we’ve collected 432,990 emails to be included in this years accessibility report, about 23,000 more email than were analyzed in the 2024 report.

Out of that number, 274 emails could not be analyzed, bringing the total of emails analysed down to 432,716. Only 15 emails contained no issues, representing two brands.

> **Result**
>
> [99.89]% of HTML emails tested contain accessibility issues categorized as "Serious" or "Critical".

**This report was created in collaboration with our partner, Parcel.io**

## Funding
Our funding comes from our sponsors and a number of individual contributors from the email community and beyond. If you would like to support this report and help contribute to keep the EMC going, you can do so on our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/email-markup-consortium#category-CONTRIBUTE).

## The data

The data was sourced by the Email Markup Consortium Data Collection project between May 2024 and May 2025. We collected 432,990 emails from multiple industries in multiple languages. We do attempt to diversify our data set as much as possible.

If you would like to add to and help expand our dataset or find out more about it, you can read more about our [data collection project](../../../projects/#data-collection).

## Testing methodology

The testing is performed via the [Parcel](https://parcel.io/) accessibility checker. This is a tool built specifically for email accessibility tests. Learn more about the tests and what they cover by reading the [Parcel accessibility-checker documentation](https://parcel.io/docs/dev-tools/accessibility-checker).

We’d like to give huge thanks to the team at [Parcel.io](https://parcel.io/) for all the help with collecting the data and running the tests. The accessibility checker is available on the free Community plan at Parcel, so if you want to test your emails on the same criteria that we use you can do so very easily, and add it into your regular email production workflow.

## Results

### Issues severity

Accessibility issues are categorised into four depending on how serious they are. These are defined by Deque Axe as:

-  **Mild** - Considered to be a nuisance or an annoyance bug. Prioritize fixing if the fix only takes a few minutes and the developer is working on the same screen/feature at the same time, otherwise the issue should not be prioritized. Will still get in the way of compliance if not fixed. Should be very infrequent.
-  **Moderate** - Results in some barriers for people with disabilities, but will not prevent them from accessing fundamental features or content. Prioritize fixing in this release, if there are no higher-priority issues. Will get in the way of compliance if not fixed. Should be fairly common.
-  **Serious** - Results in serious barriers for people with disabilities and will partially prevent them from accessing fundamental features or content. People relying on assistive technologies will experience significant frustration as a result. Issues falling under this category are major problems, and remediation should be a priority. Should be very common.
-  **Critical** - Results in blocked content for people with disabilities, and will definitely prevent them from accessing fundamental features or content. This type of issue puts your organisation at risk. Prioritise fixing as soon as possible, within the week if possible. Remediation should be a top priority. Should be infrequent.

In our test we looked to find the highest category of issue recorded in each email:

| Issue severity | Percentage of emails   |
| -------------- | --------------------   |
| Critical       | 60.66% (269,092 emails)|
| Serious.       | 39.23% (174,026 emails)|
| Moderate       | 0.01% (53 emails)      |
| Mild           | 0.09% (394 emails)     |
| No issues      | < 0.01% (21 emails)    |

From this we can see that 99.89% of emails tested contain accessibility issues categorised as "Serious" or "Critical". These are the highest categories and fixing these issues should be considered high priority.

### Emails without issues

Out of all the emails we tested, only 21 (< 0.01%) passed without issue. And those emails came from just two brands.

* Parcel.io
* NaomiWest.ca

It's also worth pointing out that Naomi West is one of our admins and she builds the Parcel emails. So great work Naomi.

Email that pass our checks may still have accessibility issues that we cannot pick up through automated testing. For example, we check if an alt attribute is present on an image, but we do not check if the text is suitable for that image in the context of that message.

Also, some emails with mild or moderate issues may actually be very accessible as these rules often have exceptions that these emails may meet. For example, a level-one heading may be unnecessary if the message is short.

## **Top 10 most common accessibility issues in email**

#### **(1) Serious: Content inside the body should be wrapped in a dir attribute**

Issue present in 98.14% (435,326) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 1471145. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

The direction of the language set in the email client will inherit into the email content. So if the user has their email client set in a right to left language and they open an email written in a left to right language, this can cause several layout issues making it very hard to read.

##### **How to fix this:**

To fix this you can set a `dir` attribute on any direct children of the body element.

It’s important to apply the correct direction, however if you need fallback for when a direction is not set then you can set `dir="auto"`. This is not as good as setting the correct direction but it’s much better than setting nothing.

---

#### **(2) Serious: Content inside the body should be wrapped in a `lang` attribute**

Issue present in 96.67% (428,819) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 1,463,270. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

A number of email clients will remove the language setting on the `<html>` element so we need to also include it on any direct children of the body element.

##### **How to fix this:**

It’s important to apply the correct language, however if you need to have a fallback for when a language is not set then you can set `lang="und"`, this sets the language as undetermined. It’s not nearly as good as setting a language but it’s much better than setting nothing.

---

#### **(3) Serious: Tables used for formatting should have the `role` attribute set to `presentation` or `none`**

Issue present in 86.24% (382,566) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 16,417,428. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Table elements should only be used for displaying tables of data, they should not be used for laying out content.

##### **How to fix this:**

It’s better to avoid table layouts completely, however if you do use them you can reduce the negative accessibility impact for some email clients by setting an attribute of `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` on the `<table>` element.

---

#### **(4) Mild: Page should contain a level-one heading**

Issue present in 76.78% (340,605) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 324,337. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Headings are one of the [main ways screen reader users navigate a document](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey10/#finding). Placing an `<h1>` element inside the content of the email means a user can quickly and accurately find the email content.

##### **How to fix this:**

You can add an `<h1>` element around the main title of your content. However not all emails require headings, sometimes email can be short and used almost like SMS with only a few lines of text. In this case a heading may not be needed, hence why this is only listed as a mild issue.

---

#### **(5) Serious: Links must have discernible text**

Issue present in 72.04% (319,550) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 3016075. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Link text tells the user where the link is taking them, if there is no link text they won’t know what the link is for.

One of the main causes for this we’ve seen is linked images that don’t have alt text set. It’s ok to use an empty alt attribute for a decorative image, however if the image is linked it’s not decorative it’s functional.

##### **How to fix this:**

Add some text inside the link. If this issue is flagged on an image you can add some text alongside the image (but still inside the `<a>`) or you can add an `alt` attribute with text that describes the content of the image as well as the page it’s linked to. Alternatively you could add visibly hidden text inside the `<a>`, this is text that is styled to be hidden from the screen but still remains in the DOM. There is also an option to use an `aria-label` or a `title` attribute on the `<a>` however these have limited support in email.

---

#### **(6) Serious: `<html>` element must have a lang attribute**

Issue present in 67.01% (297,253) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 279,706. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Setting a language for the document helps with a range of things from translation tools to tell assistive technology how to correctly read out the content.

##### **How to fix this:**

Add a `lang=""` attribute to the `<html>` element. It’s important to apply the correct language, however if you need fallback for when a language is not set then you can set `lang="und"`, this sets the language as undetermined. It’s not nearly as good as setting a language but it’s much better than setting nothing.

---

#### **(7) Serious: Element has insufficient color contrast **

Issue present in 59.37% (263,360) of emails tested.

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Some people with low vision experience low contrast, meaning that there aren't very many bright or dark areas. Everything tends to appear about the same brightness, which makes it hard to distinguish outlines, borders, edges, and details. Text that is too close in luminance (brightness) to the background can be hard to read.

##### **How to fix this:**

Adjust either the text `color` or the `background-color` to ensure color contrast of at least 4.5:1.

---

#### **(8) Critical: Images must have alternate text**

Issue present in 51.42% (228,081) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 2,535,736. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Alternate text (or alt text) is used to describe the content of an image to people who may not be able to understand it fully just by looking at it. This could be down to a visual impairment or in the case of text in the image can also cover people with reading difficulty.

##### **How to fix this:**

An `alt=""` attribute is always needed, but in some cases can be left blank, when the image is purely for decoration and not adding content, meaning or function to the email.

---

#### **(9) Serious: Documents must have `<title>` element to aid in navigation**

Issue present in 41.35% (183,423) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 143,094. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

The title is shown when the email is viewed as a web page, it is also listed in some email clients. It shows in the tab allowing users to quickly see what the page is, it also gives screen reader users a quick introduction to the page.

##### **How to fix this:**

Add a `<title>` element to the top of your page with a short, descriptive summary of the email content. Ideally this would be descriptive of this specific email (like the subject line) but if that is complicated to include you can also use something more generic like “Email from the Email Markup Consortium”.

---

#### **(10) Moderate: Link text should be descriptive**

Issue present in 17.62% (78,162) of emails tested.

<!-- Number of appearances: 102,704. -->

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Link text tells the user where the link is taking them, non-descriptive text like “click here” doesn’t give enough information to allow the user to make an informed choice to click it or not.

This becomes a larger issue for screen reader users who may be accessing the links via a shortcut key which will jump straight to the link text or via the links shortcut menu which lists all the link text of each link. Both of these cases mean there is no outside context leading into reading the link text.

##### **How to fix this:**

Write short descriptive text inside links. If you are unable to add enough detail in the visual link text, it is also possible to add [visually hidden](https://www.goodemailcode.com/email-accessibility/visually-hidden-text) text inside a link to add more information.

It is worth noting that currently this rule is only checking for generic text in the English language, so it’s likely there are many more occurrences that have gone undetected by our tests.

---

#### **(10) Serious: Links must be distinguishable without relying on color**

Issue present in 16.91% (69,253) of emails tested.

Number of appearances: 277,536.

##### **Why it’s needed:**

Some people with low vision or color blindness may struggle to distinguish links from surrounding text when the design of the links doesn’t stand out.

##### **How to fix this:**

Make sure links have something other than colour to make them stand out. The default link style of `text-decoration: underline` is the easiest and probably the best solution. If you must only relying on color then you need to reach a contrast ration of 3:1 compared to surrounding text, however this can be a tricky balance to achieve while still maintaining sufficient contrast against the background.

## Comparing to the rule set from previous years

We've seen a small drop in email failing accessibility tests with either Critical or Serious issues. For the last 2 years this was 99.97%, this year it's dropped to 99.89%.

Although that change is small, we are seeing some bigger improvements in some of the top 10 issues with most issues seeing fewer occurrences than last year.

| Description                           | Severity | 2023 % | 2024 % | 2025 % |
|---------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Body content must have dir attribute  | Serious  | N/A    | 99.17  | 98.14  |
| Body content must have lang attribute | Serious  | 96.37  | 98.29  | 96.67  |
| Tables used for layout must have role | Serious  | 89.16  | 88.97  | 86.24  |
| Missing level-one heading             | Mild     | 81.7   | 79.23  | 76.78  |
| Links must have discernible text      | Serious  | 71.36  | 73.73  | 72.04  |
| <html> must have lang attribute       | Serious  | 72.19  | 68.32  | 67.01  |
| Insufficient color contrast           | Serious  | N/A    | N/A    | 59.37  |
| Images must have alternate text       | Critical | 55.26  | 57.89  | 51.42  |
| Missing title element                 | Serious  | 35.05  | 34.95  | 41.35  |
| Link text should be descriptive       | Moderate | 16.8   | 16.92  | 17.62  |

Contrast checks were introduced it in the 2024 report but didn't register in the top 10. Looking into it, there was a problem with the way the issue were grouped, although they were registering they weren't combining to gain significant numbers.

## Industry break down
For this years report we've broken out `.edu` (education) and `.gov` (government) senders, to see if there are any insights into those emails.

### Education
We found 113 emails from education domains. 100% failed accessibility tests. 4% with Critical issues and 96% with Serious issues.

Only 5 emails failed with a Critical issue, and that was the same issue across all 5. **Zooming and scaling must not be disabled**.

The rest of the messages failed with serious issues.

100% of emails had the following serious issues:

* Content inside the body should be wrapped in a `dir` attribute
* Content inside the body should be wrapped in a `lang` attribute
* Tables used for formatting should have the `role` attribute set to `presentation` or `none`

Also, 100% were missing an `<h1>` element.

### Government
We found 2556 emails from government domains. 100% failed accessibility tests. 7% with Critical issues and 93% with Serious issues.
The most common Critical issue was **Images must have alternate text** (6.5%), we're also seeing about 1% with **Zooming and scaling must not be disabled** (30 emails). As well as issues with **allowed ARIA attributes** (7 emails) and **invalid ARIA attributes** (4 emails).

For Serious issues;
* 85.6% **Tables used for formatting should have the `role` attribute **
* 83.72% Content inside the body should be wrapped in a `dir` attribute
* 83.72% Content inside the body should be wrapped in a `lang` attribute

Although it's only a mild issue 49% of emails had **Duplicate ID's**

## Conclusions

This is the third full year for this report and we're still seeing the same issues coming up as we have in previous years. The top 10 issues haven't changed order since last year, apart from the addition of color contrast, which can be put down to a change in the testing and reporting.

It's disappointing to see the same issue come up time and again, however we have seen lower percentages of issues which suggests improvements are being made. Messages with Critical issue have dropped from 66.68% in 2024 to 60.66% in 2025. This could suggest these fixes are being prioritized. 

We were hoping to see better standards across education and government emails becasue generally there are stricter accessibility laws for these. Although both groups have a 100% failure rate, the Critical issues are much lower than the overall stats 4% and 7% respectivly. But the sample data is low, combined it's less than 1% of total message, so we can't make strong judgements here.
