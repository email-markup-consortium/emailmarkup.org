## Companies

Companies or organisations looking to partner with or sponsor the Email Markup Consortium would find more relevant information in the [Sponsors page](/en/sponsors).

## Individuals

### Public

You do not need to become a member to help.

We aim to keep our work and communications open and public whenever possible. This means anyone with the relevant knowledge and skills can contribute to our open-source projects. And anyone can contribute to discussions on [our Forum on GitHub](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/discussions).

Here is where you can start:

- Check our [ongoing or planned projects](/en/projects)
- Check our [public repositories](https://github.com)
- Check our "help needed" labelled issues on various repositories
- Join the discussion on [our Forum on GitHub](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/discussions).

### Member

You can choose to apply to become a member if you interested in:

- Becoming involved in discussions during member meetings or in our private communication channels
- Becoming a core member/maintainer of a project
- Leading a project
- Assuming other roles within the Email Markup Consortium (e.g. admin)

We may also invite individuals who we think are a good fit and are interested in the above.

If the above describes you, please fill in our [membership application form](https://forms.gle/XVdT3JGUbLZQEHXu6).


### Supporter

We understand that many individuals may simply not have the time to contribute, but they still want to raise their hand as a supporter for the Email Markup Consortium and what we do.

If this describes you, you can fill the [supporter form](https://forms.gle/WehDtXRH5oYTVCFG6) and we will list your name as a supporter on our website.
