[Can I Email?](https://www.caniemail.com/) is an invaluable resource to email developers. In 2022, we brainstormed what we can do to use this data to shed a light on the level of support of features from the perspective of what impacts the end user.

When looking at Can I Email?, we frequently see certain clients supporting, or not supporting features, but how do we visualize this from a high level, and what is the impact?


## Categorizing HTML/CSS features

We decided (with the blessing of Can I Email’s maintainer; [Rémi Parmentier](https://www.hteumeuleu.com/)) to categorize the tested features, which would enable us to visualize the data in new ways. A category would indicate whether the support of an HTML or CSS feature is beneficial for something such as accessibility, or performance. You can now view the categorized features on the [Tags page on “Can I Email?”](https://www.caniemail.com/tags/)

As a start, we are categorizing features under the following categories:

1. **Accessibility:** features under this category are key to enabling assistive technology such as screen readers to be able to ingest email content. Email clients that support a majority of these features give email creators all opportunities to create accessible emails for their subscribers.
2. **Performance:** features under this category are key to the success of email rendering and loading.
3. **Internationalization:** This category of features outlines those that are beneficial to internationalization which would allow for developers the freedom to create semantic HTML in languages aside from English.


## The Email Client Feature Support Rankings

The categorized HTML/CSS features enable us to look at the “Can I Email?” data in a different way. For example, we can now see which email clients do a good job of supporting HTML/CSS features that impact the accessibility of an HTML email.

Based on this data, we created the [**Email Client Feature Support Rankings**](https://emailmarkup.org/en/reports/email-clients/feature-support-rankings/) in which we rank email clients in these categories based on what features they support. We hope this to become a reference not just to us, but also to email clients to evaluate whether their level of HTML/CSS features support aligns with their goals of providing their users with the best user experience possible.
