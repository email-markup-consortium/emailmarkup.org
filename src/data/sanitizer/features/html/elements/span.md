The `<span>` element is a generic container with no special meaning.

## Recommendation

It is highly recommended for an email client to support the `<span>` element. 


## Impacts

### Progressive enhancement

In the context of email in which some HTML elements are expected not to be supported by some email clients, supporting `<span>` may allow the developer to code the email with progressive enhancement in mind and implement an alternative more basic experience.

### Accessibility

While it does not have any semantic meaning on its own and is mainly used for styling, adding the `role` tag attribute can change the semantic meaning of a `<span>`. Supporting `<span>` allows the developer to group elements that semantically need to belong to the same parent or wrap some content that needs to belong to an element with a specific role.
