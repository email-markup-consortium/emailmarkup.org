Back in May 2025, we released our annual [Accessibility Report](https://emailmarkup.org/en/reports/accessibility/2025/). In this edition, we included a new section for the first time: [Accessibility in Email Clients](https://emailmarkup.org/en/reports/accessibility/2025/#accessibility-in-email-clients). The analysis in this section is based on our [Email Client Feature Support Rankings](https://emailmarkup.org/en/reports/email-clients/feature-support-rankings/), which looks at HTML/CSS feature support using data from [Can I Email?](https://www.caniemail.com/).

It took an effort over a long period of time to be able to do a data-based analysis like this. Using a data-backed approach allows us to be neutral when evaluating how email clients are doing, and often allows us to reflect the real state of email clients.

However, in this case, some of the data was outdated. The Proton team have noted a lot of the support data for Proton Mail on “Can I Email?” is outdated. They took the time to update this data themselves and contribute to “Can I Email?”. This is something worth celebrating; it is not common for an email clients to document things for email developers like this, let alone do it publicly in an open source project.

After reviewing the updated data and the updated [Email Client Feature Support Rankings](https://emailmarkup.org/en/reports/email-clients/feature-support-rankings/), we see Proton Mail scores a lot higher in accessibility and the other categories than initially recorded. As a result, we have updated our Accessibility Report 2025 to reflect this.

We’ve spoken directly with Proton Mail and thanked them for their significant contribution to “Can I Email?”. They confirmed they updated the data after reading our Accessibility Report, which caused a lovely chain reaction here:

1. Proton Mail finds out the data on Proton Mail on “Can I Email?” is outdated
2. Proton Mail updates the data on “Can I Email?”
3. Our [Email Client Feature Support Rankings](https://emailmarkup.org/en/reports/email-clients/feature-support-rankings/) gets updated with more accurate data
4. We and the world find out there is one more email client (Proton Mail) doing extremely well in regards to accessibility (proving to competitors it is possible!). 
5. Through this practice, Proton Mail identifies other HTML and CSS features they can start supporting which could improve accessibility, performance or internationalisation

It is a good day for the email industry.
